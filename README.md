# Business_A_B_Testing (Unfinished)

## Purpose

To use A/B testing in a business use-case scenario and flesh out my understanding of certain distributions and statistical comparison strategies. This particular dataset is concerning the question of whether or not the presence of a 'SmartAd' on a company's webpage changes user interactivity with a feature on the webpage.

### Method

Step 1: Get data and EDA
Step 2: Formulate question to be answered and set null and alternative hypotheses to be tested.
Step 3: Use 3 approaches to attempt to answer the stated question.
Step 3a: Use classical statistical approaches to attempt to reject the null hypothesis.
Step 3b: Use Bayesian approaches to attempt to reject the null hypothesis.
Step 3c: Use Machine Learning approaches to gain business insights into the question itself.
Step 4: Provide actionable insights using visualizations of the data and present them to the company.
